    let num = 100;
    let num2 = num;
    console.log(num, num2);
    num = 200;
    console.log(num, num2);

    // Strings are copies too

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team, players);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team[2] = 'Kelly';
    console.log(team2, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // another ES6 way
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 88});
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

     console.log(draz.social, dev.social); // two level deep rip
